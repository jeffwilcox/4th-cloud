  "readme": "# log4js-node\n\nNOTE: v0.3.8 of log4js is the last that will work with node versions older than 0.4. To use v0.3.9 you will need node 0.4 or later.\n\nThis is a conversion of the [log4js](http://log4js.berlios.de/index.html) \nframework to work with [node](http://nodejs.org). I've mainly stripped out the browser-specific code\nand tidied up some of the javascript. It includes a basic file logger, with log rolling based on file size, and also replaces node's console.log functions. \n\nNOTE: in v0.2.x require('log4js') returned a function, and you needed to call that function in your code before you could use it. This was to make testing easier. v0.3.x make use of [felixge's sandbox-module](https://github.com/felixge/node-sandboxed-module), so we don't need to return a function.\n\n## installation\n\nnpm install log4js\n\n## tests\n\nTests now use [vows](http://vowsjs.org), run with `vows test/*.js`. \n\n## usage\n\nMinimalist version:\n\n           var log4js = require('log4js');\n           var logger = log4js.getLogger();\n           logger.debug(\"Some debug messages\");\n\nBy default, log4js outputs to stdout with the coloured layout (thanks to [masylum](http://github.com/masylum)), so for the above you would see:\n\n    [2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [DEBUG] [default] - Some debug messages\n\nSee example.js:\n\n    var log4js = require('log4js'); //note the need to call the function\n    log4js.addAppender(log4js.consoleAppender());\n    log4js.addAppender(log4js.fileAppender('logs/cheese.log'), 'cheese');\n    \n    var logger = log4js.getLogger('cheese');\n    logger.setLevel('ERROR');\n    \n    logger.trace('Entering cheese testing');\n    logger.debug('Got cheese.');\n    logger.info('Cheese is Gouda.');  \n    logger.warn('Cheese is quite smelly.');\n    logger.error('Cheese is too ripe!');\n    logger.fatal('Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.');\n  \nOutput:\n\n    [2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [ERROR] cheese - Cheese is too ripe!\n    [2010-01-17 11:43:37.990] [FATAL] cheese - Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.\n\n  \n## configuration\n\nYou can either configure the appenders and log levels manually (as above), or provide a \nconfiguration file (`log4js.configure('path/to/file.json')`) explicitly, or just let log4js look for a file called `log4js.json` (it looks in the current directory first, then the require paths, and finally looks for the default config included in the same directory as the `log4js.js` file). \nAn example file can be found in `test/log4js.json`. An example config file with log rolling is in `test/with-log-rolling.json`.\nBy default, the configuration file is checked for changes every 60 seconds, and if changed, reloaded. This allows changes to logging levels\nto occur without restarting the application.\n\nTo turn off configuration file change checking, configure with:\n\n    var log4js = require('log4js');\n    log4js.configure(undefined, {}); // load 'log4js.json' from NODE_PATH\n\nOr:\n\n    log4js.configure('my_log4js_configuration.json', {});\n\nTo specify a different period:\n\n    log4js.configure(undefined, { reloadSecs: 300 }); // load 'log4js.json' from NODE_PATH\n\nYou can also pass an object to the configure function, which has the same properties as the json versions.\n\n## connect/express logger\n\nA connect/express logger has been added to log4js, by [danbell](https://github.com/danbell). This allows connect/express servers to log using log4js. See example-connect-logger.js. \n\n    var log4js = require('./lib/log4js');\n    log4js.addAppender(log4js.consoleAppender());\n    log4js.addAppender(log4js.fileAppender('cheese.log'), 'cheese');\n      \n    var logger = log4js.getLogger('cheese');\n    \n    logger.setLevel('INFO');\n    \n    var app = require('express').createServer();\n    app.configure(function() {\n        app.use(log4js.connectLogger(logger, { level: log4js.levels.INFO }));\n    });\n    app.get('/', function(req,res) {\n        res.send('hello world');\n    });\n    app.listen(5000);\n\nThe options object that is passed to log4js.connectLogger supports a format string the same as the connect/express logger. For example:\n\n    app.configure(function() {\n        app.use(log4js.connectLogger(logger, { level: log4js.levels.INFO, format: ':method :url' }));\n    });\n\n## author (of this node version)\n\nGareth Jones (csausdev - gareth.jones@sensis.com.au)\n\n## License\n\nThe original log4js was distributed under the Apache 2.0 License, and so is this.
